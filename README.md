The stakeholders need a better understanding of how annual members and casual riders differ. Also, how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
## Business Task
